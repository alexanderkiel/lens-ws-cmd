# Lens Command Webservice

The Lens Command Webservice provides the HTTP endpoint for commands in the CQRS architecture of Lens. It does the following:

* user authentication
* command coercion
* user authorization
* puts the command in a queue

## Commands

A command is a tuple of command name and params. The command name is a keyword. Params is a map.

```clojure
[:create-user {:name "John Doe"}]
```

Commands can reference attachments which can be files or arbitrary binary blobs. Referencing attachments is done by symbols in the param map.

```clojure
[:create-user {:name "John Doe" :image image1}]
```

There are two command endpoints:

## Normal Command Endpoint

This endpoint allows normal command without attachments. The batch command endpoint supports attachments. The command is encoded in the body of a POST request. The encoding is done with Transit.

The batch command endpoint is reachable under `/command`.

## Batch Command Endpoint

The batch command endpoint supports attachments. POST requests with attachments have to use multipart form data. The command is encoded in the `command` field. Attachments are in field named after the references in the command.

The batch command endpoint is reachable under `/batch-command`.
